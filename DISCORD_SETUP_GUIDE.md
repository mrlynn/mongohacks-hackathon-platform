## 🎨 Discord Server Template (Optional)

For dedicated servers, here's a clean structure:

```
📢 INFO
  #welcome - Team intro and rules
  #announcements - Important updates
  
💬 COMMUNICATION
  #team-chat - General discussion
  #ideas - Brainstorming
  #questions - Ask anything

  #bugs - Bug reports
  #resources - Links and docs
  
🔊 VOICE CHANNELS

```

---

## 📱 Sharing the Link with Your Team

**In the MongoHacks Hub:**
- Once you add the Discord link, it appears as a big button in "Your Team" section
- Team members click "Join Team Discord Channel"
- They're taken directly to Discord

**Manual sharing:**
- Copy the invite link
- Share in the hub, via email, or text
- Team members click → join instantly

---

## 🛡️ Discord Privacy & Security

**Recommended settings for team channels:**

1. **Private Channel** (in personal server):
   - Only invited members can see/join
   - No one else in your server can access

2. **Temporary Invite Links**:
   - Set expiration (7 days for hackathon)
   - Set max uses (match team size)
   - Prevents random people joining

3. **Permissions**:
   - All team members can send messages
   - All can share files
   - All can use voice
   - Only you (leader) can delete channels

## 🔄 Alternative: Slack Setup

If your team prefers Slack:

**Step 1: Create a Slack workspace** (if new team)
1. Go to slack.com/create
2. Sign up with email
3. Name your workspace: `[Team Name] Hackathon`

**Step 2: Invite team members**
1. Click "Invite People" in Slack
2. Enter team members' emails
3. Or generate an invite link

**Step 3: Get the channel URL**
1. Click on #general channel
2. Copy the URL from browser: `https://your-team.slack.com/archives/C123ABC`
3. Paste into MongoHacks team page (select "Slack" platform)

## 🎯 Best Practices

**For Team Leaders:**
- ✅ Set up communication **before** hacking starts
- ✅ Pin important messages (deadline, repo link, demo URL)
- ✅ Use voice for quick discussions, text for async
- ✅ Create a welcome message with team goals

**For Team Members:**
- ✅ Turn on notifications (at least for @mentions)
- ✅ Share progress regularly (builds momentum)
- ✅ Ask questions early (don't get stuck)
- ✅ Use voice when debugging together

---

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Invite link doesn't work
- **Solution:** Generate a new invite link with longer expiration

**Problem:** Team member can't join
- **Solution:** Check max uses setting, create new invite if needed

**Problem:** Channel is too noisy
- **Solution:** Create separate channels (#focus, #casual)

**Problem:** Lost the invite link
- **Solution:** Team leader can generate a new one anytime in Discord

## 📊 Communication Stats (Goal Setting)

**Healthy team communication indicators:**
- 🟢 Messages per day: 20-50 (during hackathon)
- 🟢 Voice sessions: 2-3 per day (short check-ins)
- 🟢 Response time: < 2 hours
- 🟢 All members active: 100% participation

**If you see:**
- 🔴 No messages for 24+ hours → Reach out to team
- 🔴 Only 1-2 members active → Encourage participation
- 🔴 Confusion/repeated questions → Pin FAQs
